# bratislava-attractions
Personal project of STU student — React + Express

Application for adding and searching posts about different touristic places in Bratislava. Frontend was implemented with React, backend – API and file server – in Express. It is a fully adaptive and functional single-page application. A user can use different filters (by posting time, by category, by distance of places from the user). An authorized user can estimate the places, add them to their list of favourite places, add such posts themselves. The posts contain such information as name, description, coordinates etc. The server database is MySQL.
A user can sign in with Google – the application uses authorization protocol Oauth.
Also the aim of the project was to take measures to provide the application security.
